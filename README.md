**In this repository you will find the translation files for the game Toziuha Night: Order of the Alchemists and Toziuha Night: Dracula's Revenge.**

## Anyone is welcome to contribute translations for the game.

I have opened this repo for people to add translations using Github's *pull request system.* Keep in mind your github username because it's the one I will use for in-game credits.

*The files are in .csv format.*

To facilitate the translation work I developed a program to modify the files if necessary:

[Localization Editor - itch.io](https://dannygaray60.itch.io/localization-editor)

Just open the csv files (inside *localization* folder) with the program I made and the translation will be easy to make.

## Notes

The translation_manager_extra_data.ini file don't touch it. Is a required file for Localization Manager software.

Some phrases do not require translation and should be used as they are in English. For example:
- Adeptis primera [or another spanish number]
- Ahuizotes
